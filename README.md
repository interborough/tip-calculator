# Tip Calculator
A simple application that calculates the amount of tip that is to be paid based on the price of the bill and the number of people that are splitting the bill. This app was created as a part of my Software Engineering class (CSCI 370) at CUNY Queens College. 

## How to Use
- Under the "Check Amount" field, you enter the total cost of the bill as a positive whole number. 
- For the "Party Size" field, you enter the number of people that are splitting the bill. 
- After these two values are inputted, click on the "Compute Tip" button, which will display both the amount of tip required from each person and the total amount of money that each person must contribute to the bill overall, rounded to the nearest integer. Both of these figures will be calculated with a 15% tip, a 20% tip, and a 25% tip.
